# AWS Edge Locations

## **What is an Edge Location?**

An **Edge Location** is a global network site that **Amazon CloudFront** and other AWS services use to store cached copies of content closer to customers for **faster delivery**. These locations help reduce latency and improve performance.

---

## **How Edge Locations Work**

1. **Origin Server (Source Data)**

   - The original content is hosted on an **Amazon EC2 instance** or another AWS storage service in a specific **AWS Region**.
   - Example: Your company stores content in **Brazil**.

2. **Edge Location (Caching Point)**

   - A copy of frequently accessed content is **cached** at an **Edge Location** near users.
   - Example: Users in **China** can access cached content in an Edge Location close to them instead of retrieving it from Brazil.

3. **Customer (End User)**
   - When a customer in **China** requests content, **Amazon CloudFront** checks if the file exists in the nearby **Edge Location**.
   - If available, the file is **delivered instantly** from the Edge Location, reducing **latency**.
   - If not available, the request is sent to the **origin server** (e.g., in Brazil), and the content is then **cached at the Edge Location** for future use.
