# **Amazon DynamoDB - Overview**

## **What is DynamoDB?**
- **Amazon DynamoDB** is a fully managed, **serverless**, **NoSQL database** designed for key-value and document data structures.
- It provides **millisecond response times** at any scale.
- DynamoDB eliminates the need for managing underlying instances, storage, or infrastructure.
- Data is stored redundantly across **multiple Availability Zones**, ensuring high availability and durability.

## **Key Features**
### 1. **Scalability & Performance**
   - DynamoDB **automatically scales** as database demand grows or shrinks.  
   - It delivers **consistent, single-digit millisecond latency** regardless of data size.

### 2. **Schema Flexibility**
   - Unlike relational databases, **DynamoDB does not require a predefined schema**.  
   - Items can have different attributes, making it well-suited for semi-structured data.

### 3. **Serverless & Fully Managed**
   - No need to **provision, maintain, or patch** servers.  
   - AWS handles **storage allocation, replication, scaling, and security**.

### 4. **High Availability & Fault Tolerance**
   - Data is **replicated across multiple AWS Availability Zones**, ensuring durability and failover support.

### 5. **Event-Driven & Stream Processing**
   - **DynamoDB Streams** capture item-level changes in real-time.  
   - Can integrate with **AWS Lambda** to trigger event-based workflows.

### 6. **NoSQL Querying Model**
   - Supports **primary key, secondary indexes**, and **conditional writes** for data retrieval.  
   - Lacks complex SQL-like joins, requiring **optimized access patterns**.

### 7. **Strong Security & Encryption**
   - Supports **IAM authentication, VPC endpoints, fine-grained access control**.  
   - Data is **encrypted at rest and in transit**.

### 8. **On-Demand & Provisioned Capacity Modes**
   - **On-Demand Mode**: Pay only for requests made, ideal for unpredictable workloads.  
   - **Provisioned Mode**: Define throughput capacity with optional auto-scaling.

## **Use Cases**
- **High-traffic applications** (e.g., gaming, IoT, e-commerce)
- **Real-time data processing**
- **Serverless and microservices architectures**
- **Caching and session management**
- **Streaming analytics with AWS Lambda**

## **Real-World Example: Amazon Prime Day**
- **On Prime Day 2019**, DynamoDB handled **7.11 trillion requests** over 48 hours.  
- Peak load: **45.4 million requests per second**.  
- Demonstrates **insane scalability and resilience** without manual infrastructure management.

## **Key Takeaways**
- DynamoDB is a **NoSQL database**, **not relational**.
- **Great for scalability**, but **not ideal for complex SQL queries**.
- **Schema flexibility** allows different attributes per item.
- **Designed for high-speed, low-latency transactions**.
